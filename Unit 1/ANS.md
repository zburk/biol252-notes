# Nervous System Divisions

## Sensory
* Somatic Sensory Division - Touch, pressure, temeperature
* Visceral Sensory Division - Stretch, pain, chemical changes

## Motor
* Somatic Motor Division - 
* Visceral Motor Division - 

### Visceral Motor Division
* Sympathetic division - 
* Parasympathetic division - 


# Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)

## Responsibilities
1. Fight or flight response
2. Rest and digest
3. Homeostasis (temperature, blood pressure, blood pH, ion balance)

## Visceral Reflexes
* Unconscious, automatic, stereotyped responses to stimulation
  * Visceral receptor > interneuron > visceral effector
### Example
High blood pressure! Glossopharyngeal nerve sends signal to medulla. Vagus nerve inhibits pacemaker to slow heart rate

## Somatic vs Visceral Innervation
### Somatic
* 1 neuron
* Releases ACh to a skeletal muscle
### Visceral
* 2 neurons
* One myelinated and one unmyelinated. **Why?**
* Releases ACh or NE

What's the benefit of myelination?
> Helps the signal travel faster

## Sympathetic vs Parasympathetic Anatomy
