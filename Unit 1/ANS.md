# Nervous System Divisions

## Sensory
* Somatic Sensory Division - Touch, pressure, temeperature
* Visceral Sensory Division - Stretch, pain, chemical changes

## Motor
* Somatic Motor Division - 
* Visceral Motor Division - 

### Visceral Motor Division
* Sympathetic division - 
* Parasympathetic division - 


# Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)

## Responsibilities
1. Fight or flight response

  Do some "flight or fight" responses occur even when we're not in distress?

  Yes! Your eyes still dilate when you're in a dark room

1. Rest and digest
1. Homeostasis (temperature, blood pressure, blood pH, ion balance)

## Visceral Reflexes
* Unconscious, automatic, stereotyped responses to stimulation
  * Visceral receptor > interneuron > visceral effector
### Example
High blood pressure! Glossopharyngeal nerve sends signal to medulla. Vagus nerve inhibits pacemaker to slow heart rate

## Somatic vs Visceral Innervation
### Somatic
* 1 neuron
* Releases ACh to a skeletal muscle. ALWAYS.
### Visceral
* 2 neurons
* One myelinated and one unmyelinated. **Why?**
  * We need myelination in our somatic to happen faster because we're moving skeletal muscles
  * Not really a good explanation why this is unmyelinated
* Releases ACh or NE
  * Most sympathetic - NE
  * Most parasympathetic - ACh

What's the benefit of myelination?
> Helps the signal travel faster

## Sympathetic vs Parasympathetic Anatomy
Key: There's a difference in length

### Sympathetic
* Pre-ganglionic always short and near the spinal cord
* Long post-ganglionic
* Located in thoracolumbar origin
* Neurons innervate all over the body

Difference between normal sympathetic division and adrenal medulla?
* Still receives preganglionic neuron but acts as postganglionic neurons releasing NE to the blood

### Parasympathetic
* Reverse of sympathetic
* Still innvervates all over the body
* Cranial nerves **3, 7, 9, 10** - carry parasympathetic neurons
  * 10 - Vagus nerve - neck down innervation (digestive, heart, lungs)
* Pelvic splanchnic nerves - innervate large intestine, rectum, bladder, reproductive organs

## Dual Innervation
* WHen we add NE, what do we expect to happen?
  * Heart rate increase because NE is usually associated with sympapthetic - "flight or fight"
* When we add ACh, what do we expect to happen?
  * Heart rate decreases

* Does the sympathetic response cause the same effect across the body? (Everything increases or decreases activity)
  * No. Heart rate increases but digestion decreases.
  
### Physiology
* Cholinergic synapses release ACh
* Nicotinic receptors respond to ACh

* Adrenergic synapses release NE
* Muscarinic receptor responses to muscarin
